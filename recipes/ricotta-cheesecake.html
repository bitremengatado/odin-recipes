    <p>
        This ricotta cake bakes into a texture that's hard to describe: eggy and creamy like a custard, but still light and cakey.<br />
        It's extremely delicious on its own, but makes a wonderful canvas for any fruit preparation.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    
    <h3>Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 375F.
            Butter the <em>bottom</em> of a springform pan and line it with parchment paper.
            Butter <em>just the parchment paper</em> and set the pan aside.
        </li>
        <li>
         In a food processor, combine the ricotta and heavy cream and process until the mixture is very thick, whipped, and completely silky smooth, about 1 minute.   
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the 5 egg yolks, the lemon zest, vanilla, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and 1 cup of the sugar (7 oz / 200g) to the ricotta mixture. 
            Pulse the food processor, scraping down the bowl once, until all of the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is smooth and fluid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the flour and pulse just to combine.
            Transfer the ricotta mixture to a large bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer), beat the egg whites and the pinch of salt on medium-low just to break them up.
            Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the whites form soft peaks.
            Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and continue to beat on high until the whites are shiny, quadrupled in volume, and hold a firm peak off the end of the beater.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scrape the egg whites into the bowl with the ricotta mixture and use a large flexible spatula to gently fold the mixture until no streaks remain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
            Bake until the edges are deeply browned and the center is risen, cracked, and golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (it will still wobble quite a bit when done).
            Transfer the pan to a cooling rack.
            The cake will fall and crater immediately, which is normal.
            Let the cake cool completely in the pan.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan or medium Dutch oven, combine the granulated sugar, wine, salt, and 1 cup water (8 oz / 227g).
            Squeeze the lemon half into the saucepan and toss in the rind as well.
            Scrape in the vanilla seeds and add the pod. Set the saucepan over medium heat and stir occasionally until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.
            Bring the poaching liquid to a very gentle simmer, then add the rhubarb.
            Continue to cook over medium heat, swirling the pan gently (don't disturb the rhubarb too much—you want it to keep its shape), just until you see the mixture start to bubble around the edges of the pan.
            Remove from the heat and set the pan aside to cool completely; the rhubarb will slowly poach from the residual heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the strawberries and rose water.
            Spoon 3 tablespoons of the warm rhubarb poaching liquid into the bowl with the strawberries, toss gently, and set aside while the rhubarb finishes cooling.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream, starting on medium-low and increasing the speed gradually to high as the cream thickens, until you have soft peaks.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <p>Use a small offset spatula or paring knife to cut around the sides of the pan to release the cake and remove the metal ring. Top it with the whipped cream, strawberry and rhubarb or serve it aside.</p>
