        <p>These awesome blossom onion bites are a great way to capture the magic of a fried blooming onion, and they are much easier to make than deep frying a whole onion at home. A recipe for the perfect dipping sauce is included. Salting the onions to remove excess moisture is optional, but highly recommended for the best texture and flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
      <ul>     

        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons horseradish</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

      </ul>
    
    <h3>Blossom Onions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups diced onions</li>

        <li>1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>

        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>

        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

        <li>2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed for frying</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
<li>For sauce, stir sour cream, mayonnaise, ketchup, and horseradish together in a small bowl. Taste and season with cayenne; refrigerate until needed.</li>

<li><strong>Optional</strong>: add diced onion to a bowl, stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, cover the bowl, and let stand for 15 minutes to draw moisture out. Transfer onions to a strainer and rinse thoroughly under cold running water; let drain for about 5 minutes, then transfer onions to a dry bowl.</li>

<li>To the bowl with diced onions, add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, cornmeal, flour, and baking powder, and stir to combine. Pour in milk; stir until a very thick batter forms. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before frying.</li>

<li>Heat vegetable oil, 1/2-inch deep, in a heavy-duty skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a plate with paper towels.</li>

<li>Drop batter by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil. Fry until nicely browned and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to the prepared plate to drain for a minute before serving. Fry onion bites in batches until all batter is used; cooked bites can be kept warm in the oven while you work. Serve with sauce. </li>
